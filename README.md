This repository is a hodge podge of different projects. It is my progress through an online Udemy course. I have learned (in chronological order): HTML, CSS, Bootstrap framework, Javascript, about the DOM, Jquery, Nodejs, Express, ejs, and more packages, a bit of SQL, MongoDB and MongooseDB. Different branches hold different projects that I have done through the course.
