        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Science. I focus on distributed systems and my goal is to become a fully fledged blockchain engineer.</p>

          <h3>Teamwork</h3>
          <p>I work best in teams. I believe it is very important to get along with everyone to help maximize performance of the team. It is not just my belief, but also a part of my people-person personality that to raise the performance of the overall team, I have to work as hard as I do on my technical teams as I do on my athletic teams. 😊</p>

          <h3>Life Long Learner</h3>
          <p>It's not my computer science degree that I am most proud of. I am also not most proud of my ability to learn all the things that I learned. <em>I AM</em> most proud of my love for learning new things! Which is why I had a fun time going down the rabit whole that is computer science! 📖 </p>
